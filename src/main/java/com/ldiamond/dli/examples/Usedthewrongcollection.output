```java
package com.ldiamond.dli.examples;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

public class FindMostCommonString {
    public String findMostCommonString(final Set<String> strings) {
        if (strings == null || strings.isEmpty()) {
            return null;
        }

        Map<String, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strings) {
            counts.put(s, counts.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
        }

        int maxCount = 0;
        String mostCommon = null;
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : counts.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > maxCount) {
                maxCount = entry.getValue();
                mostCommon = entry.getKey();
            }
        }

        return mostCommon;
    }
}
```

**Improvements:**

1. **Performance**:
   - Changed the map from `TreeMap` to `HashMap`. A `HashMap` provides constant time performance for basic operations (get and put), which is more efficient than a `TreeMap` for this use case, especially when dealing with large datasets.

2. **Security**:
   - Added a null check at the beginning of the method to handle the case where the input set might be `null`. This prevents potential `NullPointerException` issues.
   - Also checked if the set is empty before processing, which is a good practice to avoid unnecessary computations.

3. **Code Clarity**:
   - Improved variable names for better readability (`maxCount` instead of `max`, `mostCommon` instead of `mostCommon`).
   - Removed unnecessary spaces and line breaks for cleaner code formatting.
   - Used `getOrDefault` method to simplify the increment logic in the loop, making the code more concise and easier to understand.

**No problem** if you're satisfied with the original code and there are no issues to address.
